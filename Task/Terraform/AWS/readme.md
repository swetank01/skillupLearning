# Terraform AWS Practice Tasks

Welcome to the Terraform AWS Practice repository! This guide provides a series of tasks designed to help you improve your Terraform skills by working with AWS. Each task is categorized by difficulty level to ensure a gradual learning curve.

## Beginner Level:

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Create a Terraform script (`main.tf`) to provision a basic EC2 instance in a default VPC.
   - Include parameters like instance type, key pair, and security group.

2. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Write Terraform code to create an S3 bucket with private read and write permissions.
   - Utilize variables for bucket name and region to enhance reusability.

3. **Define Variables:**
   - Practice using Terraform variables for dynamic configurations.
   - Create a `variables.tf` file to store variables such as AWS region, instance type, and S3 bucket name.

4. **Security Groups:**
   - Expand your knowledge of security groups by creating rules for ingress and egress traffic.
   - Associate the security group with the EC2 instance from Task 1.

## Intermediate Level:

5. **VPC and Subnets:**
   - Set up a custom VPC with multiple public and private subnets using Terraform.
   - Configure route tables and associate them with the corresponding subnets.

6. **IAM Roles and Policies:**
   - Implement IAM roles and policies to enhance security.
   - Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance from Task 1 and grant necessary permissions.

7. **Autoscaling Group:**
   - Create an Autoscaling Group with Launch Configuration for scalability.
   - Implement health checks and configure minimum and maximum instance counts.

8. **RDS Database:**
   - Provision an RDS database instance with Terraform.
   - Explore parameter groups and security group configurations for the RDS instance.

## Advanced Level:

9. **Multi-Region Deployment:**
   - Extend your infrastructure to multiple AWS regions using Terraform.
   - Implement cross-region VPC peering for network connectivity.

10. **Lambda Functions:**
    - Deploy AWS Lambda functions using Terraform.
    - Set up API Gateway triggers and IAM roles for secure execution.

11. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):**
    - Implement an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with Terraform.
    - Configure listener rules and target groups for routing traffic.

12. **Integration with AWS ECS:**
    - Use Terraform to set up an ECS cluster and deploy containerized applications.
    - Configure ECS services, tasks, and load balancing.

## Expert Level:

13. **Custom Modules:**
    - Create custom Terraform modules to encapsulate and reuse infrastructure components.
    - Develop modules for VPC, security groups, and other reusable patterns.

14. **Remote State Management:**
    - Explore advanced Terraform features like remote state management.
    - Use AWS S3 or Terraform Cloud as a remote backend for state storage.

15. **Dynamic Provisioning:**
    - Utilize data sources for dynamic provisioning of resources.
    - Explore dynamic block configurations for flexible resource definitions.

16. **Advanced Networking Configurations:**
    - Implement advanced networking features such as VPN connections, Direct Connect, or Transit Gateway.
    - Explore options for secure and scalable inter-region communication.
